<h1>Title: Development of Data Acquisition Software for Time-of-Flight Photoelectron-Photoelectron Coincidence Spectrometers</h1>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Within the scope of this thesis work, software has been developed for two time-of-ﬂight multi-electron coincidence spectrometers at AlbaNova University Center in Stockholm. This software consists of <a href="software/TDC_module.tar.gz">a Linux driver for a special time-to-digital converter (TDC) card</a>, and some <a href="software/DAQ_suite.tar.gz">software for data acquisition – a server and a client</a>.</p>
<p>The server functions as a middleman between the driver and the client, and enables data acquisition from the spectrometers via TCP/IP (over a network). The software can be used to acquire multiple types of coincidence spectra. The most important details for using the software are documented in this report.</p>
<p>
The developed data acquisition software and TDC card driver were used to record time-of-ﬂight photo-electron spectra of O<sub>2</sub><sup><small>+</small></sup> , and time-of-ﬂight photoelectron-photoelectron coincidence spectra of Xe<sup><small>2+</small></sup>. Studies of these spectra revealed ionic states in accord with what is known in the literature, and indicate that the software developed works as intended.</p>
